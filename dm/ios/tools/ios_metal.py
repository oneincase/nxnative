# -fmetal-math-mode=relaxed: keep fast math's reassociation / contraction, but forbid assuming there are no NaN / Inf. The translated shaders reproduce Maxwell's NaN semantics with isnan selects (8337 / 12809 use them),
# and the default fast mode lets each GPU's backend compiler treat them as always false; on the A20 Pro the opening course's odd frames had 727k NaN pixels in the main image (a few dozen with the same AIR on the M4 Pro), which became the black band / black-edged glow
# -fpreserve-invariance: [[invariant]] position outputs only agree across shaders with this flag (as dmsh_build.py's MAC_METAL: a depth pre-pass followed by a less-or-equal G-buffer)
# -O1: -O2's switch folding leaves a control-flow graph Apple's GPU backend can only lower slowly into very large code (as dmsh_build.py's MAC_METAL)

# Brackets nested past clang's default limit of 256 ("bracket nesting level exceeded maximum of 256"): the translator opens a block for every forward branch to a common exit, so a guest
# loop unrolled with an early exit after each step nests a block a step (Ocarina of Time's agl_technique_pfx compute shaders 1f78730053feb036 and e172bd7ec218ab8e: 257, an unrolled
# 256-element walk). Only such a source compiles with DEEP: the flag only raises the limit, so the output is what the plain compile would give if it could, and the compile records
